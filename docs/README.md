# Book Builder Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Book Builder project. We separate documentation into "Core" (Strategy/Architecture) and "Ops" (Daily Execution/QA).

## Structure

### 🧠 [Core Documentation](./core/)
*High-level strategy, architecture, and planning.*
- [Architecture](./core/architecture.md): Overview of the technical stack and key concepts.
- [Ideas](./core/ideas.md): Brainstorming and future feature planning.

### 🛠️ [Operations Documentation](./ops/)
*Daily working documents for QA, debugging, and deployment.*
- [QA Log](./ops/qa_log.md): A log of bugs and findings during the QA process.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a robust territory balancing and assignment tool for sales operations ("RevOps").
